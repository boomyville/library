# Book Tracker
A javascript / CSS / HTML project based on the Odin Project that allows a user to record books they have read.

Some reflection
- I used a fair amount of Llama 3 AI to assist with this project; I got a bit lazy and helped speed up boring bits like boiler plate or writing blocks of code repeatedly
- This project was mainly trying to consolidate the concept of prototypes and object constructors in Javascript but I felt like this project didn't really require any of that
- I learnt how to create a modal thanks to Llama 3 AI but ended up using a javascript function to generate the HTML; in hindsight it would've been easier to make the modal in HTML (so bake it into the website) and toggle its visibility
- No crimes using innerHTML were performed though not using innerHTML made it really wordy to code <div> and add it to other <div>
- I need to work on my UI design...
